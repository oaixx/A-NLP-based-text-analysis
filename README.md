This project aims to perform natural language processing and topic modeling analysis on policy documents. 
It utilizes various Python libraries, including pandas, nltk, sklearn, gensim, and matplotlib, to preprocess 
the text data, extract features, and apply Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Latent Dirichlet 
Allocation (LDA) algorithms for topic modeling. The project also includes sentiment analysis by calculating 
the proportion of negative and uncertainty terms to further analyze the content. Finally, we use a regression 
model to evaluate the impact of topic changes on market volatility. This project demonstrates a complete workflow
from text data preprocessing to advanced analysis and visualization.
