"Physics is dead…" This is a quote from Nobel Prize-winning author Liu Cixin's "The Three-Body Problem." I think this phrase is quite fitting for the current state of natural language processing: "NLP is dead…" The emergence of ChatGPT at the end of 2022 revolutionized NLP, but before that, NLP had significantly aided my work. From an academic perspective, it helped me analyze policies, patents, and technology development trends during my time at CAICT, thereby understanding the motivations, evolution, and trends of technology, markets, and governments. By analyzing authoritative documents such as policies, bills, and plans released by the government and media, I identified correlations that supported my research in AI, 5G, supply chains, and other areas.I will illustrate the application of NLP in enhancing public policy analysis through a publicly available case. By using text analysis to examine policy documents, we can achieve both qualitative and quantitative analysis.

 In this project, I use a case study of analyzing policy documents with NLP and topic modeling to illustrate my understanding of NLP. The project aims to perform natural language processing (NLP) and topic modeling analysis on policy documents. It utilizes various Python libraries, including pandas, nltk, sklearn, gensim, and matplotlib, to preprocess text data, extract features, and apply Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithms for topic modeling. The project also incorporates sentiment analysis by calculating the proportions of negative and uncertainty terms to further examine the content. Finally, a regression model is used to assess the impact of topic changes on market volatility. This project showcases a comprehensive workflow from text data preprocessing to advanced analysis and visualization.
